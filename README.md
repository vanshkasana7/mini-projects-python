# mini-projects-python
collection of electrical and electronics mini projects using python


1.RLC circuit simulation
simulates series RLC circuits to calculate resonance frequency and impedance. generate plot for frequency vs impedance and  export results to csv for analysis.
key features :-
1. calculate resonance frequency automatically.
2. plots inpedance vs frequency curve.
3. export simulation data for further analysis.
